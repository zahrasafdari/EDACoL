# Time Series Forecasting with Advanced Neural Networks

Welcome to the Time Series Forecasting project! This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for time series forecasting, leveraging advanced neural network architectures to make accurate predictions. The following guide will help you understand how to get started, how the model is structured, and how to use the provided code effectively.

## Project Overview

This project employs a sophisticated neural network model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based layers to forecast time series data. It is designed to handle both daily and monthly data features, preprocessing them to build a robust forecasting model.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling:** Efficient loading and preprocessing of time series data.
- **Model Architecture:** A hybrid model combining CNN, LSTM, and Transformer layers for improved forecasting performance.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Includes callbacks for early stopping and saving the best model to prevent overfitting.
- **Visualization:** Plots for training history and comparison of predictions with actual values.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### 2. Data Preparation

Ensure your data files are in the `data` directory:
- `dailyt30_features.npy`
- `monthly_features.npy`
- `dailyt30_target.npy`
- `monthly_target.npy`

The data files should be preprocessed as described in the code. The script will automatically handle loading and preprocessing.

### 3. Model Training

The model is defined in the `build_model` function, which creates a hybrid architecture of CNN, LSTM, and Transformer blocks. The training process involves:

- **Compiling** the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
- **Fitting** the model with early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to save the best-performing model.

Run the training script:

```python
python train_model.py
```

### 4. Evaluation and Visualization

After training, the script evaluates the model's performance and generates visualizations:

- **Training History:** Plots showing the loss curves for both training and validation sets.
- **Predictions vs Actuals:** Scatter plots comparing predicted values with actual observations.

## Code Structure

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Handles data loading, scaling, and reshaping.
- **Model Definition:** Builds a hybrid model with CNN, LSTM, and Transformer layers.
- **Training and Callbacks:** Includes early stopping and model checkpoint mechanisms.
- **Visualization:** Plots training history and prediction accuracy.

## Example Usage

Here's a brief overview of how to use the provided code:

1. **Load and preprocess your data** using the script.
2. **Build and compile the model** with the `build_model` function.
3. **Train the model** using the `fit` method with appropriate callbacks.
4. **Evaluate and visualize** the results with provided plotting functions.
